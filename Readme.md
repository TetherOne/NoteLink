# NoteLink
### Description
The idea of ​​the project is to create a platform for exchanging text information. For example, a user can write some text, a title for it, select a public post or not and publish it, and then share a link with friends to their text. A public entry will appear in the public domain, but for private ones a longer link is created and only authenticated users can see it.
The user can also set the lifetime of a record after which the record will be deleted from the database.
